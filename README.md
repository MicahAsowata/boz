# Boz
Boz is a leaderboard project built with vanilla JS.


## How to use
1. To use Boz you need to have Node JS

You can check whether you have Node JS or not by running the following

```
node -v

// Output would look like this if you have Node JS installed
v18.16.0

```
If you don't have Node JS check [here](https://youtu.be/hdyrjVrgK-I) for installation instructions


2. Clone the repo
```
mkdir boz-test

cd boz-test

git clone https://github.com/MicahAsowata/boz.git

```

3. Enter the boz directory and run the code
```
cd boz

node boz.js

```

### Note
Boz was built with foundational knowledge of JS that was learnt [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhW0NCG7M536uHGOtJ95Ut2) and it was built in one night. 

If you notice any buugs or any addition that you would like to make please go ahead and clone the repo, do what you want and create a pull request.
